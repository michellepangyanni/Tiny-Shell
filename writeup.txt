TESTING STRATEGY

<
eval, initpath, builtin. 主要是search path
1. Input a invalid PID to test that 
>
(
NOTES:
5-10: 
empty string in path
current directory is in the path
invalid input -> command not found
invalid pid, jid, 
the code switch between background and foreground correctly

1. edge case 2. input to that code 3. what code is testing 

errors 
wrong command
reference solution behavior 
more test cases and why include it

eg. 
pass an input that does not exit either in current d or d path
when enter a nonexitent bgfg. 

strange behavior in reference solution. 

test input a path that does not start with . or /.
write as much as possible. 
20 + . 
invalid jid, include both alphebet and number. )
