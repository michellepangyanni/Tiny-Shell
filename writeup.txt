TESTING STRATEGY

White Box Testing
1. Test that the kernel can properly send a SIGINT to the shell.
   eg. type ctrl-c at the keyboard.
   Code: Line 760 - 778.
2. Test that the kernel can properly send a SIGTSTP to the shell.
   eg. type ctrl-z at the keyboard.
   Code: Line 791 - 809.
3. Test that the error handling is correct when missing PID or jid argument 
   after fg command.
   eg. type fg.
   Code: Line 522 - 526. (if statement in line 522)
4. Test that the error handling is correct when missing PID or jid argument 
   after bg command.
   eg. type bg.
   Code: Line 522 - 526. (if statement in line 522)
5. Test that the error handling is correct when fg is not followed by a valid
   PID or jid.
   eg. type fg a; type fg *.
   Code: Line 551 - 555 (else statement in line 551)
6. Test that the error handling is correct when bg is not followed by a valid
   PID or jid.
   eg. type bg a; type bg *.
   Code: Line 551 - 555 (else statement in line 551)
7. Test that job can be identified by a valid PID.
   eg. type fg 1; type fg 5; type bg 1; type bg 5.
   Code: Line 541 - 550 (Line 544 will perform correctly.)
8. Test that job cannot be identified by an invalid PID.
   eg. type fg 99999999999; type bg 999999999999.
   Code: Line 547 - 550 (Line 547 will evaluate to true.)
9. Test that job can be identified by a valid jid.
   eg. type fg %1; type fg %5; type bg %1; type bg %5.
   Code: Line 530 - 540 (Line 533 will perform correctly.)
10. Test that job cannot be identified by an invalid jid.
   eg. type fg %99999999999; type bg %999999999999.
   Code: Line 536 - 539 (Line 536 will evaluate to true.)
11. Test the case that the command line is empty, tiny shell should 
    ignore empty lines. 
    eg. type nothing in shell.
    Code: Line 314 - 315
12. Test the case that an invalid path name of an executable program 
    is given in the command line.
    eg. tsh> -bin/csh, tsh> ./myspin
    Code: Line 374 - 375.
13. Test the case that an invalid executable name is given in the command line
    eg. tsh> /bin/echo1
    Code: Line 350 - 354
14. Test the case that the list of directories is empty.
    eg. tsh> / / /
    Code: 362 - 375
15. Test the case that one of the directories is the current directory
    eg. tsh> pwd 
    Code: Line 362 - 372

MICHELLE's NOTES
****//You need only explain what part of your code is tested by each case.//****
eval, initpath, builtin. 主要是search path
1. Input a invalid PID to test that 
(
NOTES:
5-10: 
empty string in path
current directory is in the path
invalid input -> command not found
invalid pid, jid, 
the code switch between background and foreground correctly

1. edge case 2. input to that code 3. what code is testing 

errors 
wrong command
reference solution behavior 
more test cases and why include it

eg. 
pass an input that does not exit either in current d or d path
when enter a nonexitent bgfg. 

strange behavior in reference solution. 

test input a path that does not start with . or /.
write as much as possible. 
20 + . 
invalid jid, include both alphebet and number. )
