TESTING STRATEGY

White Box Testing
1. Test that the kernel can properly send a SIGINT to the shell.
   eg. type ctrl-c at the keyboard.
   Code: Line 760 - 778.
2. Test that the kernel can properly send a SIGTSTP to the shell.
   eg. type ctrl-z at the keyboard.
   Code: Line 791 - 809.
3. Test that the error handling is correct when missing PID or jid argument 
   after fg command.
   eg. type fg.
   Code: Line 522 - 526. (if statement in line 522)
4. Test that the error handling is correct when missing PID or jid argument 
   after bg command.
   eg. type bg.
   Code: Line 522 - 526. (if statement in line 522)
5. Test that the error handling is correct when fg is not followed by a valid
   PID or jid.
   eg. type fg a; type fg *.
   Code: Line 551 - 555 (else statement in line 551)
6. Test that the error handling is correct when bg is not followed by a valid
   PID or jid.
   eg. type bg a; type bg *.
   Code: Line 551 - 555 (else statement in line 551)
7. Test that job can be identified by a valid PID.
   eg. type fg 1; type fg 5; type bg 1; type bg 5.
   Code: Line 541 - 550 (Line 544 will perform correctly.)
8. Test that job cannot be identified by an invalid PID.
   eg. type fg 99999999999; type bg 999999999999.
   Code: Line 547 - 550 (Line 547 will evaluate to true.)
9. Test that job can be identified by a valid jid.
   eg. type fg %1; type fg %5; type bg %1; type bg %5.
   Code: Line 530 - 540 (Line 533 will perform correctly.)
10. Test that job cannot be identified by an invalid jid.
   eg. type fg %99999999999; type bg %999999999999.
   Code: Line 536 - 539 (Line 536 will evaluate to true.)
