TESTING STRATEGY

White Box Testing
1. Test that the kernel can properly send a SIGINT to the shell.
   eg. type ctrl-c at the keyboard.
   Code: Line 760 - 778.
2. Test that the kernel can properly send a SIGTSTP to the shell.
   eg. type ctrl-z at the keyboard.
   Code: Line 791 - 809.
3. Test that the error handling is correct when missing PID or jid argument 
   after fg command.
   eg. type fg.
   Code: Line 522 - 526. (if statement in line 522)
4. Test that the error handling is correct when missing PID or jid argument 
   after bg command.
   eg. type bg.
   Code: Line 522 - 526. (if statement in line 522)
5. Test that the error handling is correct when fg is not followed by a valid
   PID or jid.
   eg. type fg a; type fg *.
   Code: Line 551 - 555 (else statement in line 551)
6. Test that the error handling is correct when bg is not followed by a valid
   PID or jid.
   eg. type bg a; type bg *.
   Code: Line 551 - 555 (else statement in line 551)
7. Test that job can be identified by a valid PID.
   eg. type fg 1; type fg 5; type bg 1; type bg 5.
   Code: Line 541 - 550 (Line 544 will perform correctly.)
8. Test that job cannot be identified by an invalid PID.
   eg. type fg 99999999999; type bg 999999999999.
   Code: Line 547 - 550 (Line 547 will evaluate to true.)
9. Test that job can be identified by a valid jid.
   eg. type fg %1; type fg %5; type bg %1; type bg %5.
   Code: Line 530 - 540 (Line 533 will perform correctly.)
10. Test that job cannot be identified by an invalid jid.
   eg. type fg %99999999999; type bg %999999999999.
   Code: Line 536 - 539 (Line 536 will evaluate to true.)
11. Test the case that the command line is empty, tiny shell should 
    ignore empty lines. 
    eg. type nothing in shell.
    Code: Line 314 - 315
12. Test the case that an invalid path name of an executable program 
    is given in the command line.
    eg. tsh> -bin/csh, tsh> ./myspin
    Code: Line 374 - 375.
13. Test the case that an invalid executable name is given in the command line
    eg. tsh> /bin/echo1
    Code: Line 350 - 354
14. Test the case that the list of directories is empty.
    eg. tsh> / / /
    Code: 362 - 375
15. Test the case that one of the directories is the current directory
    eg. tsh> pwd 
    Code: Line 362 - 372
16. Test execution of built-in command.
    eg. type quit; type jobs; type fg; type bg 
    (These are covered by trace files.)
    Code: Line 477 - 492.
17. Test execution of built-in command of sigleton &.
    eg. type &.
    Code: Line 493 - 495.
18. Test a command that is not a built-in command.
    eg. type back; type *.
    Code: Line 496 &
          Line 352 - 356 (if statement in Line 352 will evaluate to true.) 
19. Test the case when we runs the program in the foreground.
    eg. tsh> /bin/ls -l -d
    Code: Line 331- 333.
20. Test the case when we runs the program in the background.
    eg. tsh> /bin/ls -l -d &
    Code: Line 334 - 338.
21. Test the case when we restart a job and runs it in background.
    eg. /bin/echo tsh> bg %1; /bin/echo tsh>  bg 1
    Code: Line 573 - 579.
22. Test the case when we restart a job and runs it in foreground.
    eg. /bin/echo tsh> fg %1; /bin/echo tsh> fg 1
    Code: Line 564 - 568.
23. Test the functionality of eval.
    eg. all combination of program and built-in command described 
          above and below, since all command argument will run through
          eval.
    Code: Line 299 - 388.
24. Test the functionality of waitfg.
    eg. Send another foreground job while there is one foreground job running.
           type quit quit.
           Explanation: quit is a foreground job. While the first quit is 
           executing, the second quit is waiting. 
    Code: Line 593 - 621.
25. Test the case when the executable file path name starts with a "."
    eg. type ./tsh
    Code: Line 350 - 356.
26. Test the case when the executable file path name starts with a "/"
    eg. type /usr/bin/ls
    Code: Line 350 - 356.
27. Test the case when the executable file path name is a subdirectory 
    in the current directory.
    eg. go to clear home directory and type shell-michellepangyanni/tsh.
    Code: Line 350 - 356.
28. Test the case that the search path contains an empty string, 
    this should be interpreted as the current directory being
    located in the search path.
    Code: Not enter for loop in line 643. 
29. Test the case when there are two ":" in a row in the search path,
    or the path starts or ends with the “:” character, the
    search path should be loaded when the program is initialized.
    Code: Line 634 - 666.
30. Test a valid search path where each directory is separated by
    the “:” character.
    Code: Line 634 - 666.
31. Test the case when the search path contains empty string. 
    Code: Line 634 - 666.
